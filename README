== Project Description

A-List was intended to be a web application built on Rails (2.x) that 
allowed you to share and discuss web pages with your friends.

Started around the time as Reddit, A-List was planned to have very similar 
functionality, but with a greater focus on discussion with your known friends,
as opposed to the masses of largely unknown internet commenters.


== Project Status

A-List has not been developed in over 4 years and no plans are held for future
development. 

It is kept online (for now) mainly as a personal, historical record of a past
project.

== Legal

The code in this repository written by the above developers is released free
of copyright and may be used for any purpose, commercial or otherwise,
with no requirement that the authors be credited.

But really, the only thing "of use" here is a bit of sample code illustrating
how to use a few basic components of Rails 2.x. Not very useful, is it?
